# Introduction

Kali Linux is a penetration testing and security auditing Linux distribution. After its first release (**Kali 1.0**) in **March 2013**, Kali Linux has quickly become every hacker's favourite OS for pentesting. Replacing its predecessor Backtrack, Kali incorporated several new features and looks quite promising. It is available for i386 and amd64 architectures and has the same **Minimum Hardware Requirements** as Backtrack: *1 GHz CPU, 8 GB of Hard Disk Space, 300 MB RAM, and DVD writer (For live DVD creation). It also has the ability to boot with a pen drive as Kali is Live Linux Distribution.*

**Kali 2.0** was released on **11th August, 2015**. It was a huge success and made the life of pentesters so easy. The enhanced GUI and more tools in version 2.0 played a major role behind its success. This time Kali can also run on Raspberry Pi's and other embedded devices, making the creation of intercepting devices and rouge WiFi so easy.

Even though there are a lot of tutorials on how to use different hacking tools on the Internet, a person could not find all the tutorials in a single place. This open source book on Kali Linux is mainly for the **complete documentation and tutorials** of all the tools present in Kali linux. It also contains extra Github repository links, which are used for hacking and digital forensics and tutorials on how to use them.

This book is an initiative of the community **"Hack with Github"**.
