# Structure of the Book

The book is a documentation of all the tools present in Kali Linux. The tools have been grouped together into separate chapters on the basis of their usage. This book also contains tools which are not included in Kali. Tutorials are added at the end to make this book more hacker-friendly.

Some tools have been repeated in different sections because of their capability to be used for several purposes. Articles present in each chapter will contain links, tutorials and documentation of the given tool as per the chapter requirement.

For example, Burp Suite is present in Password Attacks, Web Application and Sniffing & Spoofing. This is because Burp Suite can be used for all the above said purpose. So the article 'Burp Suite' in Web Application will consist of the information required for using it to hack a Web Application.

Complete documentation of important tools have been added to this book and are linked to their respective articles.
